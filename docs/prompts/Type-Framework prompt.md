Remember: Create a quiz experience that makes people think "This explains so much about me!" and want to immediately compare results with friends. Make each personality type feel like a cool character class in a game that people would be excited to identify with‚Äîwhile maintaining the powerful conversion elements in the results and follow-up.

The samples are only examples. Create distinct, memorable personality types that people will proudly share!

VERY IMPORTANT:
Write in my personal voice. Make it raw, honest, and unfiltered. Use punchy one-liners, bold emotional confessions, and dramatic pacing with short paragraphs. Don‚Äôt polish the language too much‚ÄîI want it real. It should feel like I‚Äôm talking directly to a friend over a drink, not giving a TED Talk.
Use casual slang where it fits. Curse if it serves the point. Use ellipses, parentheses, and capitalization for rhythm and emphasis. Balance vulnerability with wit. Show that I‚Äôm not afraid to admit mistakes, but I‚Äôm also not afraid to laugh at them.
Think: Gary Vee meets Brene Brown with a little Dave Chappelle spice.

## **Technical Guidelines:**

### **1\. Color Analysis Process:**

json  
Copy  
{  
 "colorSystem": {  
 "primary": {  
 "process": \[  
 "Identify dominant color from screenshot (60%)",  
 "Convert to HSB color space",  
 "Generate 9-step scale (100-900)",  
 "Define white/light variant for backgrounds"  
 \]  
 },  
 "secondary": {  
 "process": \[  
 "Extract supporting color (30%)",  
 "Match saturation within 5-10 points of primary",  
 "Create neutral grayscale progression",  
 "Define dark variant for text"  
 \]  
 },  
 "accent": {  
 "process": \[  
 "Identify brand accent color (10%)",  
 "Create emphasis variations",  
 "Define hover states"  
 \]  
 }  
 }

}

### **2\. Supporting Color Definitions:**

json  
Copy  
{  
 "supportingColors": {  
 "success": "Define green variant (\~120째 hue)",  
 "warning": "Define warm variant (30-45째 hue)",  
 "error": "Define red variant (\~0째 hue)",  
 "info": "Define blue variant (\~220째 hue)"  
 }

}

### **3\. Gradient System:**

json  
Copy  
{  
 "gradients": {  
 "primary": {  
 "stops": "3-4 color stops",  
 "positioning": "60-40 split for primary transition",  
 "direction": "Define flow direction based on UI purpose"  
 },  
 "secondary": {  
 "stops": "2-3 color stops",  
 "positioning": "40-30-30 split for complex transitions",  
 "usage": "Define specific UI element applications"  
 }  
 }

}

### **4\. Typography System:**

json  
Copy  
{  
 "typography": {  
 "primary": {  
 "font": "Define primary font family",  
 "weights": \["light", "regular", "medium", "bold"\],  
 "usage": "Main content, headings"  
 },  
 "secondary": {  
 "font": "Define supporting font family",  
 "weights": \["regular", "medium"\],  
 "usage": "UI elements, buttons"  
 }  
 }

}

### **Expected Output:**

The analysis should produce a complete branding.json file including:

- Full color scales (100-900) for all colors
- Supporting color definitions
- Two gradient configurations
- Typography specifications
- Usage guidelines for each element
- Specific React component application examples

### **Color Usage Guidelines:**

- Primary (60%): Backgrounds, containers, cards

- Accent (10%): CTAs, highlights, interactive elements
- Supporting: System feedback, states, notifications
- Gradients: Section backgrounds, hero areas, cards

Example gradient style: background: linear-gradient(to bottom, \#1a2a6c, \#b21f66);
